# Sales_Forecast_Regression_Analysis
DESCRIPTION:

The objective of this project is to develop a robust time series forecasting model that can accurately predict the unit sales for various items sold in Favorita stores. Favorita is a leading grocery retailer based in Ecuador, and the company's sales data will be used to build the model. The data set contains sales data for thousands of items sold at different stores, making it a challenging and complex problem.

To build an accurate forecasting model, various statistical and machine learning techniques will be used. The data will be preprocessed to ensure that it is clean, consistent, and in the right format for analysis. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be employed to gain a deeper understanding of the data and identify any patterns or trends in the sales data.

Time series forecasting models, such as ARIMA, Linear regression and machine learning model-Prophet will be used to predict store sales. These models will be trained using historical sales data, and their accuracy will be evaluated using various performance metrics such as root mean square logarithmic error, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE).

The results obtained from the forecasting models will be analyzed, and insights gained from the analysis will be used to make informed business decisions. The insights could include identifying which products have high demand at different times of the year, which stores perform better than others, and identifying any trends in sales data that could inform marketing and inventory decisions.

Overall, the project aims to build a reliable time series forecasting model that can help Favorita optimize their sales strategies and improve their bottom line.
